JSocial
=======

A social coding experiment in Javascript
(inspired by the original [python socode](https://github.com/sricola/socode))

To contribute:

You can view the current state of the project here: http://thisjustin.github.io/JSocial/

Rules:
* Add a function with your Github name as its name to the jsocial.js file
* DO NOT edit the index.html file (if you want to add anything there, use javascript :)
* Your function can do anything and everything, as long as it finishes in a reasonable amount of time. No infinite loops, please.
* Once your function is written, you can call it from anywhere else in the already existing execution chain.
* Never entirely delete anyone else's function. Edit it if needed.
* jQuery 2.0 is included for your convenience

If we're lucky maybe we'll make something useful or at least interesting.
